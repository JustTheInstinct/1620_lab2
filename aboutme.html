    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>
        I reside in White Rock, Canada. I have two dogs named Toby
        and Brutus. On my free time, I play a lot of video games and
        card games. I play games such as Brawlhalla and Magic: The gathering.
        For a future career I plan to become a video game designer or a
        security admin for databases.
